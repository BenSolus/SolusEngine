# libcc

The cc library is a collection of C/C++ functions using solely the C++ Standard
Library and, if necessary, operating system specific APIs like POSIX. This
library offers miscellaneous functions and constants like formatted explanatory
strings of exceptions and the full path to the top level of the build tree.
